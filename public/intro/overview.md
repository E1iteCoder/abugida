- **Hear how it sounds** by exploring the seven built-in vowel “orders” (ä, u, i, a, e, ə, o) that combine with every base consonant.
- **Visualize the syllabary grid**, lining up consonants down the side and vowel forms across the top for easy reference.
- **Master stroke order** with step-by-step animations, so you can confidently write every variation.
